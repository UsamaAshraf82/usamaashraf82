## History
Ever since I can remember, I have been interested in technology, and would constantly be on the computer tinkering, and reading about the latest and greatest gadgets. After getting my first computer at age 8, I was hooked. My path as a geek was set. With my interest in games, and how they work, I started to learn and grow as a programmer. It would be my honor to help make technology work for you!
